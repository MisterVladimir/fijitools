Introduction
------------------

*fijitools* is a Python API for working with [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Welcome)/[FIJI](https://fiji.sc/) region of interest (ROI) data. To be clear, ROI means things like bounding boxes, ovals, points, etc. overlaid on an image; an ROI is any way of marking a region of interest for further processing and analysis.


Installation
------------------  
pip install fijitools  


Features 
------------------
**ROI I/O**: Reading ImageJ/FIJI region of interest (ROI) data saved in .zip format. ROI bytestream data from the entire .zip file is parsed all together as a single numpy array, and dispatched to classes specific to each ROI type. Currently all ROI types may be read, but we can only create Python objects for rectangles and ellipses. Python ROI instances may be converted back to ImageJ/FIJI bytestreams, saved as .zip files, and read by ImageJ/FIJI.

**CSV Parsing**: Uses regular expressions to filter ImageJ/FIJI data generated with the RoiManager -> Multi-Measure tool and saved as CSV files.

**Convenience Functions**: various data structures and functions to make life easier. It includes specialized data structures for managing parsed ImageJ/FIJI data. These functions are being migrated to [vladutils](https://github.com/MisterVladimir/vladutils).


TODO
------------------
**ROI I/O**: Saving text ROI in ImageJ/FIJI format (zip files). With this feature, rectangle or ellipse ROI originally generated by the Python API, can be visualized with text labels in ImageJ/FIJI. This is especially useful if we want to inspect ROI data output by, say, a segmentation algorithm.
